  "pli-tv-pvr13:2.1": "[Sp.5.361](): _Tattha diṭṭhaṃ diṭṭhenāti gāthāya ayamattho – ekeneko mātugāmena saddhiṃ ekaṭṭhānato nikkhamanto vā pavisanto vā diṭṭho, so taṃ pārājikena codeti, itaro tassa dassanaṃ anujānāti. Taṃ pana dassanaṃ paṭicca pārājikaṃ na upeti, na paṭijānāti. Evamettha yaṃ tena diṭṭhaṃ, taṃ tassa ‘‘diṭṭho mayā’’ti iminā diṭṭhavacanena sameti_, “The meaning of _diṭṭhaṃ diṭṭhena_ in the verse is this: a monk is seen emerging or entering a place alone with a woman, and one accuses him of an offense entailing expulsion, and the monk admits to what the other has seen. What was seen does not amount to an offense entailing expulsion, and he does not claim it. So in this case, what was seen by him agrees with his statement, ‘It was seen by me.’” "
