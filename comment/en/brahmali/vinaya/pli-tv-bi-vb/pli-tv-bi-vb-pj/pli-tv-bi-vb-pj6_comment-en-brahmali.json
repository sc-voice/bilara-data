Whenever a monastic is obliged to inform of another monastic’s offence, the informing happens either to an individual or to a Sangha. In fact, the word _gaṇa_ is occasionally used to refer to a Sangha: (1) _Na, bhikkhave, ūnadasavaggena gaṇena upasampādetabbo_ “You should not give the full ordination in groups of less than ten” (pli-tv-kd:1.31.2.3); (2) _Gaṇo nāma bhikkhunisaṅgho vuccati_, “A group: the Sangha of nuns is what is meant” (pli-tv-bi-vb-pc26:2.1.6); (3) At _bhikkhu-pācittiya_ 32, _ganabhojane_ refers to eating in a group of four or more, that is , a Sangha; (4) at _bhikkhunī-saṅghādisesa_ 4, _gaṇa_ seems to refer to the Sangha.

  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:2.1.14": "_Saliṅge ṭhitā vuccati_. This is explained in the sub-commentary ([Vin-vn-ṭ.1989]()) as: _saliṅge tu ṭhitāyāti pabbajjāliṅgeyeva ṭhitāya_, “For one remaining in the characteristic means: for one remaining in the characteristic of being gone forth.”"
