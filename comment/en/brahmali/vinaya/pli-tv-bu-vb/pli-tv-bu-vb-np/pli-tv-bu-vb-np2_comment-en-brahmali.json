A _hammiya_ is a stilt house with a bare roof.” Rather than try to name each of these buildings, which in any case would not be useful for practical purposes, I have instead grouped them together as “stilt house”.

I arrive at the length of the forearm as follows. According to a report published by Imperial College London (http://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/173634/dutch-latvian-women-tallest-world-according/), the height of an average Indian man in 1914 was 162 centimeters. We may perhaps assume that the average height of an Indian man at the time of the Buddha was roughly the same, say 160 centimeters. If we further assume, following The Buddhist Monastic Code I (p.465), that the forearm (_hattha_) is one quarter the length of a person’s height, we then have a forearm measure of 40 cm.",
