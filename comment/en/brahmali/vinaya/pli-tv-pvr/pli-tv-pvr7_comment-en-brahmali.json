  "pli-tv-pvr7:1.26": "[Sp.5.321](): _Desitā gaṇanūpagā nāma yā dhuranikkhepaṃ katvā puna na āpajjissāmīti desitā hoti. Agaṇanūpagā nāma yā dhuranikkhepaṃ akatvā saussāheneva cittena aparisuddhena desitā hoti. Ayañhi desitāpi desitagaṇanaṃ na upeti. Aṭṭhame vatthusmiṃ bhikkhuniyā pārājikameva hoti_, “_Desitā gaṇanūpagā_ means cases where, having put down the burden, one confesses, saying, ‘I will not commit again.’ _Agaṇanūpagā_ means cases where, not having put down the burden, one confesses with an impure mind that is still effective. For this confession does not go towards counting as confessed. This concerns only the eighth factor of the offense entailing confession of the nuns.” [Vin-vn-ṭ.2005]() clarifies further: _Dhuranikkhepanaṃ katvāti ‘‘na punevaṃ karissāmī’’ti dhuraṃ nikkhipitvā. Desitā gaṇanūpikāti desitā desitagaṇanameva upeti, pārājikassa aṅgaṃ na hotīti attho._ … Saussāhāya desitāti puna āpajjane anikkhittadhurāya bhikkhuniyā desitāpi āpatti desanāgaṇanaṃ na upeti_, “_Dhuranikkhepanaṃ katvā_ means putting down the burden by saying, ‘I will not do it again.’ _Desitā gaṇanūpika_ means what has been confessed comes to be counted as confessed; the meaning is that it is not a factor of the offense entailing expulsion. _Saussāhāya desitā_ means, if a nun has not put down the burden in regard to what has been committed, then even if the offense is confessed, it does not come to be counted as a confession.” \n"
