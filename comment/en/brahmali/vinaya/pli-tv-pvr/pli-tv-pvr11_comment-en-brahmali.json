  "pli-tv-pvr11:10.2": "[Sp.5.341](): _Kārakoti ekaṃ saṅghena saddhiṃ adhikaraṇaṃ vinicchinitvā pariveṇagataṃ parājitā bhikkhū vadanti ‘‘kissa, bhante, tumhehi evaṃ vinicchitaṃ adhikaraṇaṃ, nanu evaṃ vinicchinitabba’’nti. So ‘‘kasmā paṭhamaṃyeva evaṃ na vaditthā’’ti taṃ adhikaraṇaṃ ukkoṭeti. Evaṃ yo kārako ukkoṭeti_, “_Kārako_: having decided a legal issue together with the Sangha, he goes to the precincts, where the defeated monks say, ‘Venerable, why did you decide the legal issue in that way? Should it not be decided in this way?’ Saying, ‘Why did you not say this straightaway?’ he reopens that legal issue. In this way, the original doer reopens it.” "
