One should have mind of loving kindness with compassion and empathy, and be concerned and work for the welfare of the parties involved. One should speak succinctly and to the point, without being angry or argumentative. He should assess himself, the others, the accuser, the accused, one who accuses illegitimately, one who is accused illegitimately, one who accuses legitimately, and one who is accused legitimately. Not mangling what has been said, nor proclaiming what has not been said, he should carefully scrutinize the sentences and words under consideration, question the others, and deal with them according to what they have admitted. He should gladden those who are confused, relax those who are frightened, restrain those who are fierce, and expose those who are impure. Being moral and gentle, one should not be swayed by desire, anger, confusion, or fear. One should be impartial in regard to the Teaching and the people involved. ",
